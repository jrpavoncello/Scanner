Project: Scanner

This is a java program that takes a path to a .csx file, consumes the file, tokenizes it, and prints out to console the tokens it encounters inside parentheses along with their (line, column) found within the file. Line comments and block comments will not be tokenized, but will be displayed, however.

Main method is in P2.
